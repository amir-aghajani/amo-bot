# Orders and payments

«فروش › سفارش‌ها» and «فروش › پرداخت‌ها», in both panels. An **order** is what a customer buys — a service («خرید»), a
renewal («تمدید»), extra traffic or time for a service they have («حجم اضافه», «زمان اضافه» —
[Bot settings](Bot-Settings.md#extra-traffic-and-time)), a top-up of their wallet («شارژ کیف پول») or, in the main shop,
an agent's traffic («خرید حجم نمایندگی») —, and a **payment** one attempt to pay it, by one method.

Nothing is ordered until the customer picks a way to pay. The wallet pays at once and the order is delivered there and
then; a card transfer waits for its receipt and your review. An order and its payments move on once, however many
people press at the same moment — two tabs, the report group, the timer —, and only the decision that stood tells the
customer.

| Order status | Means |
|---|---|
| «در انتظار پرداخت» | Waiting to be paid — its receipt may be with you |
| «پرداخت‌شده» | Paid; its delivery has not started |
| «در حال ساخت» | Being delivered — the panel is being asked |
| «تکمیل‌شده» | Delivered |
| «ناموفق» | Paid, but its delivery failed: it waits for a retry |
| «لغوشده» | Cancelled — by you, or unpaid for 48 hours |
| «بازپرداخت‌شده» | Refunded |

A payment is «در انتظار پرداخت» (no receipt yet), «در انتظار بررسی» (its receipt waits for you), «پرداخت‌شده», «ناموفق»
(its receipt was rejected, or the wallet refused it), «لغوشده» or «بازپرداخت‌شده».

## Payments

«پرداخت‌ها»: every payment customers started. The tabs are «همه», **«در انتظار بررسی»** — the receipts to review, counted
beside it and in the menu —, «پرداخت‌شده», «ناموفق» and «در انتظار پرداخت»; cancelled and refunded payments are under
«همه». Search by a payment's or an order's number or a customer (`#12` is payment 12 alone), filter by «تاریخ» (the days
it was started) — and by a customer, from their page —, sort by «مبلغ» or «زمان». The line above the list says how many
of the payments on screen were paid and their sum.

**A payment's dialog** — «بررسی» on a receipt waiting, «جزئیات» on the rest — shows the receipt («نمایش در اندازه کامل»,
«دانلود رسید» for one the browser cannot draw) and its facts: the customer, what it pays for, its order (a link), the
method and card, the customer's caption, when it was started, sent and paid, who decided and why. Then what may be done
with it now:

| Operation | Offered | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| «تایید و تحویل» («… شارژ کیف پول», «… افزودن حجم», «… افزودن زمان») | A card payment not paid yet, its order still open — with a receipt, or without one («تایید دستی و …») | **At one press.** The order is paid and delivered at once — the service made or renewed, its extra traffic or time added, the wallet charged, the agent's traffic added —, the order's other attempts to pay are cancelled (but a receipt waiting for review, which stays yours to reject), a referrer's commission is paid, and the customer gets their service or word of it |
| «رد کردن» | A receipt waiting for review | Asks for a reason the customer reads («دلیل رد کردن»). The payment fails; the order stays open for them to pay again |
| «لغو پرداخت» | Any payment not paid | Asks for an optional note. Cancels this payment, and — while nothing else paid it — its order with every other attempt to pay it; the customer is told when it cancelled the order. **But while another payment of the order has a receipt waiting for review**, this payment is cancelled alone: that receipt may be the money, so the order and the receipt stay for you to decide, and the customer is told nothing |
| «یادآوری به مشتری» | A card payment waiting for its receipt, or rejected, its order open | At one press: a reminder with «ارسال رسید» and «پرداخت دوباره» (a rejected one, «پرداخت دوباره» alone). Nothing changes; the toast says whether it reached them |
| «تلاش دوباره برای تحویل» | A paid payment whose order's delivery failed, or stalled for ten minutes | At one press: the delivery again ([Orders](#orders)) |
| «بازپرداخت به کیف پول» («بازپرداخت شارژ» for a top-up) | A paid payment whose order is not being delivered right now | Asks first, with an optional note: [refunds](#refunds) |

An approval whose delivery failed says why — the panel's words — and stays open, its retry in reach; the order waits under
«سفارش‌ها» › «نیازمند رسیدگی». A note is 300 characters at most — a refund's 190, since it is the line the customer reads in
their wallet. A decision the payment no longer allows — someone decided
it a moment ago, here, in the report group or by the timer — is refused with what happened («این پرداخت تایید شده است.»,
«سفارش این پرداخت با پرداخت دیگری پرداخت شده است.»), and the dialog shows the payment as it is now.

**«بعدی»** opens the next payment of the list as you see it, so receipts are reviewed one after another: after a
decision the dialog stays on the decided payment with «بعدی» ready.

**The reminder's outcome**: «یادآوری فرستاده شد», «… با ایمیل فرستاده شد» (a customer Telegram cannot reach), or
«یادآوری فرستاده نشد» with why — they blocked the bot, Telegram or the mail server was out of reach, or the customer has
no Telegram account and no email went.

**What the customer reads** of a decision is a reply to the receipt they sent in the bot (a plain message for one
uploaded on the website; an email for a customer Telegram cannot reach), with no buttons; your note is its «توضیح
پشتیبانی: …» line. Every notice is kept on their website too.

**Who decided** is recorded on the payment: your login, an agent's «@bot», a bot admin's handle (or `tg:<id>`, or
`user#<id>` for an account of the website alone) from the report group or the shop's website, or «تایید خودکار» for
the review window. Anyone but you reads your login as «پشتیبانی».

Receipts are also decided from the report group's «رسیدها», by the bot's admins: «✅ تایید» and «❌ رد» — with or without a
reason — do what this dialog does ([Report group](Telegram-Group.md)). The bot's admins may work this screen from the
shop's website too, while it lets them in ([Website](Website.md#the-shops-admins)) — there they approve only a payment
whose receipt waits for review, and refund only when the website grants it. **An admin never approves or refunds their
own payment**, in the group or on the website: another admin, or you, does. A card's review window approves a receipt
sent in the bot that nobody decided in time ([Payment methods](Payment-Methods.md#approving-receipts-by-themselves)).

## Orders

«سفارش‌ها»: every order. The tabs are «همه», **«نیازمند رسیدگی»** — paid and not delivered: the delivery failed, or
nobody has been delivering it for ten minutes, while the payment that paid it stands; counted beside it and in the menu
—, «در انتظار پرداخت», «تکمیل‌شده», «لغوشده» and «بازپرداخت‌شده». Filter by «نوع», «تاریخ» (the days it was placed) and a
customer; search by an order's number, a customer, a plan or a service's name (`#12` is order 12 alone); sort by «مبلغ»
or «زمان». The line above it says how many were sold and their sum.

**An order's dialog** — «رسیدگی» on one to deliver again, «جزئیات» on the rest — shows what it bought (the plan, the
server, the service — a link to it —, and how much a service's extra traffic or time, or an agent's traffic, comes to:
«حجم اضافه ۱۰ گیگابایت», «زمان اضافه ۷ روز»), why it failed or was cancelled, when it was placed, paid and delivered, and
its payments, each a link to the payments screen, where receipts, refunds and reminders are. The list's «بابت» says the
same: a service's extra as its amount over the service's name. Two operations belong to the order:

- **«تلاش دوباره برای تحویل»** — at one press: the delivery again, once whatever stopped it is fixed (the server back, the
  agent's traffic bought). The customer hears of it only when it works; failing again, the dialog says why and stays. A
  delivery another process is doing right now is not started twice.
- **«لغو سفارش»** — an order not paid yet, a receipt in review included: asks for an optional note — the question counts
  the receipts waiting for review it will drop —, cancels every attempt to pay it, then the order. The customer is told
  when they had started paying it, nobody otherwise.

**Why a delivery fails** is the order's «خطای تحویل»: a panel's failure — the full diagnosis for you (its address, its
answer, in any shop), a short word for anyone else who reads the order (an agent, the shop's admins on its website) —, a
rule's refusal (no server can sell the plan now, the agent's traffic is short — the agent is told in the main bot), or
«تحویل با خطای داخلی برنامه متوقف شد؛ …» for a fault of the shop's own, whose details are in the log. The report group's
«خطاها» says it the same way: the diagnosis in the main bot's group, the short word in an agent's.

## Refunds

«بازپرداخت» gives back what a payment paid, by what its order bought:

- **A service** — the service the purchase made goes first: its client off its panel and the service off the shop,
  quietly (the refund's message says so). Then the amount goes into the customer's wallet («بازگشت وجه پرداخت #12»),
  less the cashback the order earned, if any ([Cashback](Loyalty-Cashback-And-Draws.md#a-refund)). In an agent's shop the
  traffic the sale drew goes back into the agent's pool («بازگشت حجم سفارش بازپرداخت‌شده #12»). Refused, with nothing
  refunded, while:
  - its panel does not answer — the refusal says what the panel said; delete the service from
    [its dialog](Services.md#when-the-panel-fails-a-delete) with «حذف فقط از فروشگاه», then refund;
  - another order of the service is paid or still open — a renewal, extra traffic or time —, named in the refusal: it
    paid for that service too. Refund or cancel it first, or delete the service yourself and then refund.

  A purchase whose service is gone already (deleted, or its delivery failed) is refunded with nothing to remove.
- **A renewal, or a service's extra traffic or time** — once delivered, what it gave the service is taken back first, on
  its panel: a renewal's term and traffic as it gave them (even if its plan changed since), an extra's days or traffic.
  The deadline moves back by them — to now, ending the service, when that is past —, and the quota shrinks by them
  (never to nothing: a service that used more than it keeps ends by traffic). A service that never ends, or is
  unlimited, keeps that part. A renewal queued behind the current period loses its traffic. Then the amount goes into
  the customer's wallet, less the cashback the order earned; in an agent's shop the traffic it drew goes back to the
  agent's pool. It is taken back once: a refund refused after it (decided meanwhile) takes nothing more the next time.
  Refused, with nothing refunded, while the service is switched off by support (changing it on its panel would switch
  it on: switch it on, or delete it, first) or its panel does not answer (refund again once it does). One never
  delivered (its delivery failed) gave nothing, and nothing is taken back; a service gone already has nothing to take
  back either.
- **A top-up of the wallet** — give the money back yourself, outside the shop: the refund takes the same amount out of
  their wallet, and is refused once they spent it (an agent's credit counting). A top-up never delivered moves nothing
  in the wallet, and the customer is told their balance did not change.
- **An agent's traffic** — the amount into the agent's wallet, and the traffic out of their bot's pool — refused, all of
  it, once they sold from it.

It is refused while the order is being delivered — and when it was delivered in the moment between the refund's
check and the refund itself: refund it again, and what it gave is taken back then. The customer is told, as a reply to
their receipt — with a line saying the purchase's service was removed
(«🗑️ سرویس … که با این خرید ساخته شده بود حذف شد.»), or what the renewal or extra gave was taken back
(«↩️ زمان و حجمی که این سفارش به سرویس … داده بود پس گرفته شد.») — bot texts you may reword.
A referrer's commission stays paid.

## What runs by itself

- **Deliveries left behind** — an order paid while the bot was restarting, untouched for ten minutes, is delivered by
  the scheduler (every minute, the longest-waiting first). A failed one waits for you.
- **Unpaid orders expire** — an order nobody paid, with nothing done to it or its payments for **48 hours**, is
  cancelled within ten minutes after (an order made with a discount code sooner —
  [Discounts](Discounts.md#uses-and-giving-them-back)): quietly, its rows kept, a rejected receipt's reason kept, the
  receipts uploaded for it on the website deleted. **An order whose receipt is with you never expires.**
- **Receipts approved by themselves** — a card's review window ([Payment methods](Payment-Methods.md)).

## Watch out for

- **«تایید», «یادآوری» and «تلاش دوباره» run at one press**: no second look.
- **Cancelling a payment of an unpaid order cancels the order** — and every other attempt to pay it —, unless another of
  its payments has a receipt waiting for review: then that payment alone goes, and the receipt is still yours to approve
  or reject. «لغو سفارش» drops everything, receipts in review included.
- **A failed delivery of a paid order is yours**: nothing retries it by itself. The dashboard's «نیازمند توجه» and the
  menu's count say when one waits; the report group's «خطاها» hears each, with «🔁 تلاش دوباره برای تحویل».
- **Working an agent's shop**, their orders and payments are theirs to read too: they see your decisions as
  «پشتیبانی».
